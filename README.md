# Weather_Application
This is a weather Application that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. This Weather App provides users with current weather information and hourly forecasts for a specified city. I used the OpenWeather One Call API (Links to an external site.) to retrieve weather data for cities [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api), also i used JavaScript and momentjs.
 Users can search for a city, and the app will display the current weather conditions along with an hourly forecast for the next 24 hours.
